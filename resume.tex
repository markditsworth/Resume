\begin{eventlist}

\item{Apr 2019 -- Present}
    {Capital One}
    {Data Engineer}
    
-- Supported a petabyte-scale data lake for cybersecurity and network telemetry data.

-- Architected and implemented an automated rehydration service for a fleet of Elasticsearch clusters, saving 80 man-hours semi-monthly.

\item{Jul 2018 -- Apr 2019}
    {Raytheon, Information \& Intelligence Services}
    {Systems Engineer}
    
%-- Submitted and authored a design paper detailing a proposed overhaul of the internal project management systems.\\
