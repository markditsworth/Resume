\section{Work experience}

\begin{eventlist}

\item{Apr 2019 -- Present}
    {Capital One}
    {Data Engineer}
    
%-- Developed and implemented a shard allocation optimization program for elasticsearch clusters to alleviate disk usage issues.\\
-- Supported a petabyte-scale data lake for cybersecurity and network telemetry data.

-- Modularized and increased reliability of automated deployments of the Elastic stack and Apache NiFi clusters.

\item{Jul 2018 -- Apr 2019}
    {Raytheon, Information \& Intelligence Services}
    {Systems Engineer}
    
%-- Submitted and authored a design paper detailing a proposed overhaul of the internal project management systems.\\
-- Created a Bayesian statistical model to predict an interval of high
likelihood for security clearance investigation completion. An average
error of $\pm$5 days was observed.

\item{Jun 2014 -- Jul 2018}
     {Renewable Energy \& Vehicular Technology Lab}
     {Graduate Research Assistant}

-- Coded a reinforcement learning algorithm for training a fault-tolerant
microgrid controller.\\
-- Architected and implemented cloud applications for IoT data collection
and processing for real-time fault diagnostics.\\
%-- Constructed the prototype for a novel method for tolerating misalignment in wireless power transmission coils.

%\item{Jun 2016 -- Aug 2016}
%     {AT\&T Foundry Innovation Center}
%     {Technical Intern}
%
%-- Developed a proof-of-concept for dynamically managing
%access to wireless subnetworks for use cases
%in hospitality.\\
%-- Created a platform
%to aid executives in optimizing workplace efficiency
%by intercepting data from an OTS electrical outlet energy tracker,
%and correlating energy usage with indoor tracking
%data.
